Title: Building a Basic Banking System - My Experience

Hey everyone!

I recently completed a project that I'm really excited to share with you all - building a basic banking system. The project was assigned to me as a task, and I'm glad to say that I was able to successfully complete it. In this post, I want to share my experience and some of the things I learned along the way.

The task was to create a simple dynamic website that would allow for the transfer of money between multiple users. The website would have the following flow: Home Page > View all Customers > Select and View one Customer > Transfer Money > Select customer to transfer to > View all Customers. The website did not require a login page or user creation

The first step in building the website was designing the database schema for the customers and transfers table. I created a customers table with basic fields such as name, email, and current balance, and a transfers table to record all transfers that have taken place.

After setting up the database, I created a dummy data for up to 10 customers in the customers table. I then built the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and JavaScript for the backend to handle database interactions.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was figuring out how to transfer money between multiple users. I had to make sure that the transfer amount was subtracted from the sender's account and added to the receiver's account, while also keeping a record of the transaction in the transfers table. After some trial and error, I was able to get this working smoothly.

Overall, I had a great time building this website, and I learned a lot about web development and database integration. It was a challenging project, but I feel proud of what I was able to accomplish.
